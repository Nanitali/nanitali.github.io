      all the time to get my muscel use to it, it is a challenging for me , since i have to understand the wind direction and the currents.

    “A growth mindset is when students understand that their abilities can be developed,” 
(Dweck, 2014).</em>
</h1>
    <h2>Growth Mindset: </h2>
    <p><em>“In a growth mindset, people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work—brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment.” (Dweck, 2015)

    </em></p>
    <h2>Fixed Mindset: </h2>
    <p><em>“In a fixed mindset, people believe their basic qualities, like their intelligence or talent, are simply fixed traits. They spend their time documenting their intelligence or talent instead of developing them. They also believe that talent alone creates success—without effort.” (Dweck, 2015)</em></p>
    <p>Mindsets are established sets of personal beliefs and ways of thinking that influence our behavior and attitude toward ourselves and others. Believing you are either “good at math” or “bad at math” is an example of a mindset.<br>

            Growth mindset is the belief that one’s intelligence can be grown or developed with persistence, effort, and a focus on learning. Individuals with a growth mindset believe they are capable of learning nearly anything if they work hard and accept failures and challenges as opportunities to grow

        <br>
        With 24 years of classroom teaching experience, Giselle Isbell, Athlos Academies director of Prepared Mind, understands the importance of growth mindset in education. In her early years of teaching, it was a fifth-grade student with a learning disability who first taught Isbell the power of a growth mindset. This student struggled greatly with fluency and comprehension, and school learning was hard, frustrating, and time-consuming for her.
        <br>
        With hard work and a growth mindset, Isbell’s student grew up to complete a master’s degree and find success in a fulfilling professional career...
