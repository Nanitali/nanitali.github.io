  <h1 id="home">My problems and How I fight with them</h1>
  <h2>Got blocked on a simple problem</h2>
  <p>I was totally blocked on the super fizzbuzz kata challenges, the reason I stuck and why it was a simple 
      problem, cuase i wrote the pseudocode before i start writing the code, but i start wrote with if the 
      number in the array divided 3, remain 0, print FIZZ, same way for the number divided 5, print BUZZ,
      end up, i could not pass the message can divided both 3 and 5, since the number will always test 3 or 5.
      My way of solving this problem was, i did many reserch by Googling, watching youtube, and also read the test message
      few more times, try to use all the solution code i found online and text my own function, end up, i figure out i 
        have to test the number which can divied 3 and 5 first, then filter out those numbers , and test the rest number which only 
    can divied 3 or 5. What i learnt in this case, i am improving my problem solving skill and also by reading and 
        keeping differnet methold, I understood more about the build in method. </p>
  <h2>Solved a problem in an elegant way</h2>
  <p>The challenge "where are you " took me really long time to write the function, firstly, i was confuse with
      find method and filter method, so I could not pass the challenge, and i tried differnet reserch, still could 
    not find the solution, end up i checked the sample solution , but i did not understand why it is like this.
    after i talked with my facilitor , i decided to go to campus and seeking help from my coach, by repeating the test message 
     i suddenly felt i got it, the reason i stuck also because i was misunderstanding the test message , that why all the resource i was 
    googling was base on the wrong infomation, this case i realized how important to seek help or just talk the way i was thinking
    with someone or even a rubber duck.  </p>
    <h2>how confident I feel using the problem solving techniques and process</h2>
