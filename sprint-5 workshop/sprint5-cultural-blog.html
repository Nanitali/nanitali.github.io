    Reflection - Foundations Core Skills
</h1>
<ul>
    <li>
  <h2>
    <strong>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</strong>
  </h2></li>
  <p>
    <ol>
        <li>Don't spend to much time on stuck, leave it and do the next , get back it after.</li>
        <li>Problem solving, by reasch related resouce or seeking help</li>
        <li>Woking as team, listening & looping practice, pairing coding practice.</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <li><h2>
    <strong>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</strong>
  </h2></li>
  <p>Core learing is more like a self developing skill, you get better idea of your strength and your weakness
        , more practice will help me use my strength/ the thing i am good at in an effective way, also improve my 
        weakness part, i was suprised how we could train our brain and grown mindset.</p>
  <li><h2>
    <strong>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</strong>
    <p>To be <em>Emotional Intelligence</em> is really challenging .</p>
  </h2></li>
  <li><h2>
    <strong>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</strong>
  </h2></li>
  <p>I think a good , long last developer, except they request lots of thories and knowledges support them, all the coring learning we learnt is also a key;
    after 5 weeks foundation study and practice, developer for me ,it is not only intresting, most time are frustrating, many times i questioned myself about
    am i really could become a developer? i got so annoying after i spent so much time to find a way to solve a stuck and still not see any improvement, all the 
    core learning, could be a skill to help me to overcome my prolems. It is not only important during our bootcamp course, also useful in our future Career.
  </p>
<li><h2>
    <strong>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</strong>
    <p>it is a good balance to be able to training myself and traing my skill together!</p>
  </h2></li>
  <li><h2>
    <strong>My future learning plan...</strong>
    <p>Time flies, suddenly we already at week 7, it seems like i am just get used to the life with all the folks, the time alreay gonna end, what is going to happen to me after the bootcamp?
      is it gonna be another advanture time? i am so exciting about that, within the bootcamp, we have kind of mission each day and weeks, there is a pressure push me to keep learning and digging more
      knowledges, however, after the bootcamp, it will be a time to recap and think about my weakness ,and try to study more about that, maybe also go back to check all the exercise and try to review the 
      code , since technology are developing really quick , have a hour a day to study is also one of my plan, hope i can stick on it.
      Last past 6 weeks, i glad i have chance to improve my human skill and my developing skill, also i met many awesome people, really wish in the futrue,
      i could have chance to work with them.
