    <h2>How my strengths and limitations are influenced my learning and career development?</h2>
    <p>My optimistic strengths help me to overcome many problems in my life.
    I am a fast learner and really flexible, it is easy for me to adapt in any environment.</p>
    <ol>
    <li><h3>how I will manage your workload in this programmer</h3>
    <p>Try to finish each sprint within the time box suggestion; I studied little bit before the foundation by code academy, but I still felt bit behind when I was doing the first sprint, and also confuse what I had to do to finish each sprint. I didn’t not have a plan for the sprint1, everything was rush and I felt bit Impulsive. I believe what I have to do, as my partner said, I should compare myself now to the past, rather than compare myself with other learner. Try to claim and be patient, try to not in rush to finish a challenge; try to make sure I really understand the concept and the resource content and the technical. Try to figure out the stuck by myself, I believe this is also a way to improve my skill. Only ask the smart questions.In the future, for the boot camp. </p>    
    </li>
    <li><h3>How and where I will seek help in a timely way</h3>
    <p>
        I write note during I am studying, when I need to seek help, If I remembered the note may contain the information, I usually check my handbook first, mostly I seek help from google, this is the best way to find information
    </p></li>
    </ol>
   <h2>What I expect from the facilitation team </h2>
   <ul>
       <li>Support</li>
       <li>Patient</li>
       <li>Help to improve the learning skill </li>
   </ul>
  
   <h2>Recent commitment</h2>
   <p>I have no commitment to other things during the foundation period, only thing I commitment to do is going back China on 10th march for my grandfather’s 80 years old birthday party, so I hope I would successfully and likely to finish all my sprints before that day, and looking forward to join the bootcamp and get a job after the course finish.</p>
