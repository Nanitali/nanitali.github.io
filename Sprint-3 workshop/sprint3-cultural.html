  <h1 id="home">Emotional Intelligence</h1>
  <p>Emotional intelligence or EI is the ability to understand and manage your own emotions, and those of the people
    around you. People with a high degree of emotional intelligence know what they're feeling, what their emotions mean,
    and how these emotions can affect other people.</p>
  <h2>Five key elements.</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Self-awareness.</li>
    <li>Self-regulation.</li>
    <li>Motivation.</li>
    <li>Empathy.</li>
    <li>Social skills.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>IQ vs. EQ: Which One Is More Important?</h1>

  <h2>The Difference Between IQ and EQ</h2>
  <p>
    IQ, or intelligence quotient, is a number derived from a standardized <em><a
        href="https://www.verywellmind.com/history-of-intelligence-testing-2795581" target="_blank">intelligence
        test</a></em>. On the original IQ tests, scores were calculated by dividing the individual's mental age by his
    or her chronological age and then multiplying that number by 100.
    <!-- This is IQ -->
    <ul>
      <h3>IQ reprePents abilities such as:</h3>
      <li>Visual and spatial processing</li>
      <li>Knowledge of the world</li>
      <li>Fluid reasoning</li>
      <li>Working memory and short-term memory</li>
      <li>Quantitative reasoning</li>
    </ul>
    EQ,is a measure of a person's level of emotional intelligence. This refers to a person's ability to perceive,
    control, evaluate, and express emotions. Researchers such as John Mayer and Peter Salovey as well as writers like
    Daniel Goleman have helped shine a light on emotional intelligence, making it a hot topic in areas ranging from
    business management to education.
    <ul>
      <h3>IQ reprePents abilities such as:</h3>
      <li>Identifying emotions</li>
      <li>Evaluating how others feel</li>
      <li>Controlling one's own emotions</li>
      <li>Perceiving how others feel</li>
      <li>Using emotions to facilitate social communication</li>
      <li>Relating to others</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Is IQ or EQ More Important?</h2>
  <p>IQ was viewed as the primary determinant of success. People with high IQs were assumed to be destined for a life of
    accomplishment and achievement and researchers debated whether intelligence was the product of genes or the
    environment
    However, some critics began to realize that not only was high intelligence no guarantee for success in life, it was
    also perhaps too narrow a concept to fully encompass the wide range of human abilities and knowledge.
    The concept of emotional intelligence has had a strong impact in a number of areas, including the business world.
    Many companies now mandate emotional intelligence training and utilize EQ tests as part of the hiring process.
    Emotional abilities can also influence the choices that consumers make when confronted with buying decisions.
    Nobel-prize winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman has found that people would rather deal with a person that they
    trust and like rather than someone they do not, even if that means paying more for an inferior product.

  </p>
  <h2>Can Emotional Intelligence Be Learned?</h2>
  <p>
    According to one meta-analysis that looked at the results of social and emotional learning programs, the answer to
    that question is an unequivocal yes.

    The study found that approximately 50 percent of kids enrolled in SEL programs had better achievement scores and
    almost 40 percent showed improved grade-point-averages. These programs were also linked to lowered suspension rates,
    increased school attendance, and reduced disciplinary problems.
    Some strategies for teaching emotional intelligence include offering character education, modeling positive
    behaviors, encouraging people to think about how others are feeling, and finding ways to be more empathetic toward
    others.
