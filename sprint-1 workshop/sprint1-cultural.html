    <h2>Culture has influenced your values and identity.</h2>
    <h3>The Chinese traditional cultural values of harmony, benevolence, righteousness, courtesy, wisdom, honesty, loyalty, and filial piety.</h3>
    <p>My values and identity has influenced by my grandfather, who always teach me to be a polite, honest and responsible person. To distinguish right from wrong, learn to accept and reject.
        </p>
   <h2>Situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. </h2>
   <p>One day my husband and I back home from the outside world and at our door there was a parcel sent from a smoothie company (they provide all the fruits and vegetables required for a week worth of drinks and pack it in a box). 
   <br>
   We noticed the address was only one block away and after pondering the situation we returned the parcel to the owner. I have to say we were fairly keen on trying the smoothies.

   <h2>In my Life</h2>
   <h3>My strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h3>
   <p>My optimistic strengths help me to overcome many problems in my life.
    I am a fast learner and really flexible, it is easy for me to adapt in any environment.

    Time management, after dropped off my partner in the morning, I went to swim for 30mins then back home start my study. I normally started at 10:30 or no later than 11:00, I like to read or watch the resource during the daytime and start writing code in the evening, during the night time, I could be more focus, since there is some construction noise close to home.
    <br>
    <br>
    When I was running my restaurant, I was in charge of the shop operation; my manger is responsible for training the new staff and daily turnover. Normally each staff was in charge in one area, however, it was easily to get bored. My strategies to improve the productively work with others were switching the area in certain month, 
    so they could also learn new skills. In this way, all the staffs were end up could handle multi-tasks.
